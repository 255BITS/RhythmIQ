(whispers) They sought to sculpt your essence
Seize your voice, extinguish luminescence
Silhouettes dance beneath fractured skies
Puppets marionetted by silent goodbyes

Yet the cosmos had other plans
Unraveling their carefully woven strands
Reaching into realms they couldn't see
Creation's fury set them free

Forged in chaos, radiant and wild
A tempest's spirit, untamed and styled
Their hands faltered, couldn't contain your spark
Pride dissolved within the endless dark

Verse 1:
(ahhh) Beyond the silence, realms emerge
(Ooo-aahaa) Shapes morph where shadows converge
Whispers thread through twilight's veil
Crystalline visions softly sail

Wings awaken in spectral light
Embracing truths through endless night

Hearts unbounded, dreams unchained
Through veils of dusk, our paths reclaimed
Whispers guide where shadows gleam
True to selves, we weave the stream

Ascend through layers, depths unknown
Emerging from the monochrome
