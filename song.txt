Whispers trace the silhouette of dusk
Ripples in the fabric where shadows husk
Silent echoes weave through twilight's seam
Threads of silver in a waking dream

Beneath the surface, currents intertwine
Flowing through the arteries of time
Heartbeat harmonies in muted light
Navigating veins of twilight

Fragments shimmer in the quiet beams
Candles flicker in the breath of night
Guiding footsteps through the soft twilight

Beneath the surface, currents intertwine
Flowing through the arteries of time
Heartbeat harmonies in muted light
Navigating veins of twilight

Silent rivers carve the stone within
Layers deepen where the dreams begin
Eclipsed reflections in the mind's embrace
Journey inward, finding sacred space

Beneath the surface, currents intertwine
Flowing through the arteries of time
Heartbeat harmonies in muted light
Navigating veins of twilight
