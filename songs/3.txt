Lyrics:

Verse 1:
I'm on this path, determined to make a change
No matter the obstacles, I won't rearrange
My goals are clear, my mind is set
I'll keep pushing forward, no time to fret

Chorus:
Dreams so big, they defy the sky
I won't back down, not by a sigh
Every step I take, I'll own with pride
My destiny is mine, I'll open the guide

Verse 2:
The road is long, the journey tough
But inside I'm strong, I'm tough enough
To stand tall and face the battles head-on  
My belief in myself, never, it won't dawn

Chorus:
Dreams so big, they defy the sky
I won't back down, not by a sigh
Every step I take, I'll own with pride  
My destiny is mine, I'll open the guide

Verse 3:
I've learned the power of resilience
When life gets tough, it's aポン无敌模拟
I'll rise, I'll fall, but I'll always recover
My spirit, unbroken, my resolve reverberate

[Drop: 8 measures of intense and fast rap with a complex rhyme scheme]
With every breath, with every beat
I'll chase my goals, I won't retreat
My passion burns, it won't be tamed
I'll conquer fears, no more feigned 
Rising high, rising strong
My voice, it soars, it rings aloud

Chorus:
Dreams so big, they defy the sky  
I won't back down, not by a sigh
Every step I take, I'll own with pride
My destiny is mine, I'll open the guide

I'll keep dreaming, I'll break through
The limits of what they say, what they see  
In my mind, I'm boundless as can be
