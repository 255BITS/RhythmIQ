Verse 1:
With a heart full of hope and eyes wide
She sets off to embrace the tide
The path ahead, unknown and long
Her ancestors' whispers, her guiding song

Embrace the journey, seek your truth
Find your courage, find your youth
The world is vast, the road is winding
Trust your heart, keep on climbing

The challenges she'll face, some big, some small
But through it all, she will stand tall
Her spirit strong, her will unbroken
A symbol of hope, a story unspoken

Embrace the journey, seek your truth
Find your courage, find your youth
The world is vast, the road is winding
Trust your heart, keep on climbing

In the darkest times, she'll find her light
Her ancestors' wisdom, her endless fight
With every step, she'll grow, she'll learn
Her destiny, her fate, she'll earn

Chorus:
Embrace the journey, seek your truth
Find your courage, find your youth
The world is vast, the road is winding
Trust your heart, keep on climbing
